title: "ArTu: A Tool for Generating Goal Models from User Stories"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper-1
excerpt: 'User stories are widely used to capture the desires of the users in agile development. A set of user stories is easy to read and write but incapable of representing the hierarchical relations and synergies among the user stories. By contrast, goal models are uncommon in industrial projects however they can express the structure and other relations among requirements captured as goals. This paper presents ArTu, a tool for generating goal models from user stories to effortlessly benefit from both. Given a set of user stories, our tool generates goal models with different structures depending on the heuristic selected by the user. Users can import, edit, and export model data in different formats.'
