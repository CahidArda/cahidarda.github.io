Hello, I'm Cahid Arda Ã–z, a senior computer engineering student at [Bogazici University (Turkey)](https://www.boun.edu.tr/en) with an expected graduation date in June 2024.

Feel free to explore my personal webpage to learn more about me. If you'd like to get in touch or discuss potential collaborations, don't hesitate to reach out through the contact information provided.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!

### Professional Background

I am currently working as a junior software engineer at [Invent Analytics](https://www.inventanalytics.com/), where I mostly work with PySpark for distributed data processing. My work involves harnessing the power of distributed computing to tackle complex data challenges.

### Hobbies and Interests

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. I'm passionate about sports, particularly tennis, and enjoy the strategic depth of chess. Music has always been a significant part of my life, and I'm in the process of learning to play the piano.

When I'm not engrossed in code or academics, you'll often find me watching movies. I have a deep appreciation for cinema and enjoy exploring various genres and directors; some of my favourites being Quentin Tarantino, Denis Villeneuve.

### Contributing to Knowledge

I also actively contribute to the online community by translating content from English to Turkish on [Wikipedia](https://cahidarda.github.io//portfolio/). This allows me to play a part in making information more accessible to a wider audience and bridging language barriers.

In the future, I plan to launch blogs on my webpage exploring economics and game theory. Using programming, I'll simplify complex concepts, making them accessible to a wider audience. These blogs aim to shed light on the practical applications of these subjects, fostering a deeper understanding of economic principles and strategic decision-making. I have started sharing some posts under the [Portfolio section](https://cahidarda.github.io//portfolio/) on my webpage which will eventually become my blog.
