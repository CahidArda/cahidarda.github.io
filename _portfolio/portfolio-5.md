In early 2024, I started looking into applying for a master's degree. This meant checking out various university websites to gather info on admission requirements, deadlines, and program details.

Each university had its own layout and sections for information, making things a bit confusing. I couldn't help but wish for a common interface across these sites, though I knew that was unlikely.

However, one thing that could have made my search easier was a functional search tool. This inspired me to create a RAG chatbot with a user-friendly interface, complete with a web crawler to swiftly set up a chatbot for any website.

This idea evolved into the DegreeGuru project, which you can find [on GitHub](https://github.com/upstash/degree-guru). A demo of the project is available at [this link](https://degreeguru.vercel.app/).
